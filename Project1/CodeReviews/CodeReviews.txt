The IAnimation interface appears to be minimal and sufficient. In regards to you comment about instancing the same data multiple times: 
I think that each animation will only need to be implemented once and when SpriteFactory creates a new instance of an animation it will 
only be referencing the concrete data for the concrete class, rather than duplicating the data.

Using one iteration of Sprite Factory for all animations seems to promote encapsulation, hopefully it is sufficient for all of our sprites. 
It appears to coincide with the Abstract Factory design pattern. I think the directional ENUM should be placed in its own file as I think it will be more involved elsewhere.

I like this implementation of AnimatedSprite as it allows us to use any number of frames and standardizes the frame rate for our animations. 
However, it doesn't allow for non linear frame patterns, though I think this can be compensated for in our ArrayList for individual animations.
